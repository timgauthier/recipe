# recipe
A Template for Recipes on KirbyCMS 2

This includes a blueprint for the panel, that uses a new field that updates the structured data. You may skip using the new field and simply use structured data instead of recipe in the blueprint.

#Install
This should all be able to drop into your root/site folder and work as is. You will need to style your output css on the template as you wish. I suggest making a half-grid css class that uses a 2 column layout. It may be worth exploring using other variations that allow the direction text to flow under the ingredients list once it gets past that height.

#To Do
Fix the recipe field and make it better then the hack job it currently uses.
